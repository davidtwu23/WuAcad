    <h1>Blocking</h1>
<p>Blocking is to deflect the ball coming from your opponent's attack hit. It is a technique used to prevent the opponent from a successful attack hit. The blocker is trying to block the ball back into the opponent's court. Advanced volleyball teams may have different blocking strategies. For example, one team may use a blocker to just take up space so that the defensive players can cover the rest of the court that the blocker isn't defending. Also, an advanced blocker may just try to deflect the ball to a teammate just to keep the ball in play.</p>

<p>A block is a defensive playing action at the net. A block may be performed by one front row player or a combination of front row players jumping near the net in front of an opposing attacker. The goal is to block the spiked ball with the hands or arms preventing the spiker from a successful attack.</p>
  
<p>A block assist is given when two or three players participate in a successful block at the same time. This is also known as a collective block. The responsibility of the assist blocker is to join the primary blocker to create an impenetrable block. This is called closing the block or sealing the block because the ball can't fit between the two individual blockers.</p>

<p><b>Double Block.</b>A double block is when two players are working in unison to deflect an attacked ball at the net. It's a good strategy to put up a double block as often as possible to help prevent successful attacking.</p> 

<p><b>Triple Block.</b>A triple block is when three players jump up together at the net to block. A team putting up a triple block at the net is often difficult to do successfully. Since each team has 3 players at the net that could possibly get a set to attack, it can be difficult for blockers to get in correct position to put up a triple block because you don't know who is going to be set.</p>

<p>There are different blockers:
 <ol class="customIndent">
      <li><b>Weak Side Blocker.</b>The weak side blocker is the front player that blocks coming from the left side of the court.</li>
      <li><b>Middle Blocker.</b>The middle blocker is the blocker that moves from the middle of the net to block. This player is often very quick and tall because they have the responsibility of defending against both the middle and outside hitters.</li>
      <li><b>Strong Side Blocker.</b>The strong side blocker is the blocker that blocks coming from the right side of the court. Usually an opponent's best hitter is hitting out of the strong side. Therefore, a team may decide to put their best blocker on the strong side to help defend the strong hitter.</li>
      <li><b>Offside Blocker.</b>The offside blocker is the blocker at the net that's away from the opponent's attack. The offside blocker should pull off the net to help defend the attack or get in ready position to take an approach to hit.</li>
    </ol>

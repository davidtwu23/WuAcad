  <h1>Spike and Tip</h1>
<p>A volleyball spike or attack is the strategy used to send the ball over the net to the opponent such that the ball is not returnable. The spike is performed by moving the arm in a way such that you angle the ball to land on the ground on your opponent's side of the court. A spike is hit with great force at a downward angle.</p>  

<p>However, more skilled spikers use other volleyball strategies for attacking to trick the opponent. One way to catch the opponents off guard is to tip or dink the ball. A tip or dink is performed by contacting the ball in a controlled manner with the fingers so that the ball is then quickly directed to the opponent’s court. Tipping the ball with the fingers can often be deceptive if the spiker has a reputation for hitting the ball hard.</p>

<p>The basic classical spike is made by jumping off both feet. A hitter usually takes a series of steps to attack the ball. These steps are called a volleyball approach. Its goal is to get in the best position possible to attack the ball. To learn to spike, you might start with learning the last 2 steps. Once the last 2 steps are learned, you can move on to perfecting a 3 step or a 4 step volleyball approach.

</p>
  <ul>
      <li><b>Last 2 Steps.</b> When first learning to spike, concentrate on just these last two steps and work on timing the hit. For a right-handed hitter, the last 2 steps are right foot then left foot. For a left-handed hitter, the last 2 steps are left foot then right foot.</li>
      <li><b>3 Step Approach.</b> For a right-handed hitter, the 3 step approach is left foot, right foot, then left foot. For a left-handed hitter, the 3 step approach is right foot, left foot, then right foot.</li>
      <li><b>4 Step Approach.</b> For a right-handed hitter, the 4 step approach is right foot, left foot, right foot, then left foot. For a left-handed hitter, the 4 step approach is left foot, right foot, left foot, then right foot.
</li>
    </ul>

 <p><b>Point of Contact.</b> The ball should be contacted reaching up high with the arm straight, elbow extended. The contact should be made reaching directly above or slightly in front of the body. The ball is contacted by the hand using a wrist-snapping type motion to direct the ball down into the opponent’s court.</p> 

<p><b>Trajectory of the Set.</b> The approach for the volleyball spike can also be different depending on the trajectory of the set. When attacking a ball that's set to the outside, the volleyball attacker can approach to hit at an angle coming from outside the court. This volleyball approach at an angle prepares the attacker to effectively hit the ball hard angle or turn and hit the ball down the line.</p>

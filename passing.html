     <h1>Passing</h1>

<p>Passing is one of the most fundamental skills in volleyball. It means you hit the ball at the upper body level and direct the ball to another teammate, most likely the setter. This move can be used to receive a serve from the opposing team, or as a dig that passes the ball from below. When the ball is coming towards you, the goal is to stop the ball from hitting the ground and make an accurate pass to the setter.</p> 
 
 <p> How to make a good pass? The three keys in passing are posture, platform, and position.</p>

<ol class="customIndent">
  <li><p><b>Posture:</b>Passing starts with proper posture. You should be in a low athletic posture. Your feet and shoulder should be width apart. Your knees should be slightly over your toes. </p> </li>

<li><p><b>Platform:</b>In this position, you should bring your platform together right in front of you. This should be at a 45-degree angle to the ground. You need to bring your hands together, and make sure the thumbs and wrists are tight and in line. Your shoulders should be rounded out and pressing forward. Your arms should be out in front of you. This is to ensure that you pass the ball away from your body. When passing the ball, try to move as much as possible except for when you are ready to pass the ball on contact. Ideally, you should pass the ball mid-line. If you split your body right down in the middle, this is where your platform would be. This is where you want to make contact with the ball. </p></li>
 
<li><p><b>Position:</b>The final ‘P’ is position. Following the steps above, get into your passing position. Each ball you want to take should be mid-line. This allows you to have greater control when you pass the ball. If the ball is on the outside, you need to move your feet so you can get into your position and pass in mid-line. </p></li>
</ol>


<p>Practice Tips:</p>


  
<ol class="customIndent">
  <li><p><b>Mindset:</b> You always have to be ready to move. Don't expect the ball come to you. You need to ve your feet to go under the ball. Always!</p></li>

  <li><p><b>Stance:</b> Keep your knees bend. Do not just lean forward with your torso, but drop your hips closer to ground.</p></li>

  <li><p><b>Shuffle and Pass:</b> Your goal is to move (by shuffling) under the ball and pass it in front of your body.</p></li>

  <li><p><b>Ball in Front:</b> It is not possible every time, but your absolute goal is to keep the ball in front of you when passing.</p></li>

  <li><p><b>Stop the MOvement:</b> Remember to stop your movement before the volleyball hits your forearms. This gives you a better balance. When your both feet are on the ground, it is much easier to pass the ball.</p></li>
